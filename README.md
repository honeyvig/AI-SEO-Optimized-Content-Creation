Explanation of the Code

    Generate SEO-Optimized Content:
        The function generate_seo_content() uses the OpenAI API to generate content based on the provided prompt. The content generated is SEO-focused based on the given keywords and topic.

    Extract Keywords from Content:
        The function extract_keywords() uses spaCy to extract relevant keywords from the content. This helps in identifying which keywords need to be inserted more often for SEO purposes.

    SEO Optimization Analysis:
        The seo_optimization() function performs an analysis of the generated content and an existing web page's SEO status. It prints out SEO metrics like the title and meta description (if a URL is provided) and checks the SEO score of the generated content using the SEOAnalyzer library.

    Optimize Content for SEO:
        The function optimize_for_seo() ensures that the content includes relevant keywords in an optimal way. This function also looks for missing keywords and adds them to enhance the content's SEO.

    Generate Blog Post:
        The function create_blog_post_with_seo() takes a topic and a list of target keywords, generates a blog post using the AI, optimizes the content for SEO, and performs SEO analysis.

Output Example

When running the script, the following output might be seen:

    Generated Content: A comprehensive blog post about AI in SEO.
    SEO Score: The SEO score of the content will be displayed, helping writers understand if further optimization is needed.
    Optimized Content: The final content will be optimized with appropriate keyword placement.
